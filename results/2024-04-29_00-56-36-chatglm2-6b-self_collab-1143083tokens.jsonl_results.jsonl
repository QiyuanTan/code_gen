The function first defines the input parameters and checks if they are valid, and if either `planet1` or `planet2` is not a valid planet name, the function returns an empty tuple.    \n    \nThe developer has built a dictionary `planets` with the planets as keys and the orbits of the planets as values. The orbits are ordered from closest to the Sun to the furthest.    \n    \nThe function then iterates through the planets in the dictionary, checking the distance between the orbits of `planet1` and `planet2`. If the distance falls between the orbits, the function adds the planet to the tuple.    \n    \nFinally, the function sorts the planets by proximity to the Sun and returns the tuple containing all planets whose orbits are located between the orbit of `planet1` and the orbit of `planet2`, sorted by proximity to the Sun.    \n    \nThe function looks good in terms of implementation, and it should work as expected.", "result": "failed: invalid syntax (<string>, line 18)", "passed": false}
