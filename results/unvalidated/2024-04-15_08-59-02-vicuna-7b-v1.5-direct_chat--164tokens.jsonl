It does this by looping through the array, trying to change each element to the element that is next to it on the list, and updating the number of changes needed and the current number of elements that have been changed accordingly. If the current element is not the first element, it tries to change it to the second element, and if it is the last element, it tries to change it to the second-to-last element. If an element cannot be changed in the way described above, the function does nothing. If all elements have been changed, the function returns 0.\n\nFor example, the `smallest_change` function would return `4` for the array `[1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6]`, because it would need to change the elements `1` and `9` to be palindromic, and changing either of those elements would be the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic. It would return `1` for the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]`, because it would only need to change the element `2` to be palindromic. It would return `0` for the array `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`, because it would not need to change any of the elements to be palindromic.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions."}

Then, it converts the string to a list and removes any empty elements. Next, it checks if the list is even and returns `False` if it is.\n\nThe function then loops through the list of prime numbers and checks if any of them are divisible by 2. If any are divisible, the function returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any divisors, the function returns `True`.\n\nNote that this implementation is not optimized and can be slow for large strings.
