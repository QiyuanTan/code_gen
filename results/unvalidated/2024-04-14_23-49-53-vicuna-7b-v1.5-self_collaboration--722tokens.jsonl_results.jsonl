{"task_id": "HumanEval/75", "completion": "It looks like the `is_multiply_prime` function you wrote has some issues that need to be addressed. Here are some suggestions for how you can improve the function:\n\n1. The function may not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs correctly. For example, the function may need to be modified to handle inputs of the form `-1` or `0`. You can add a check for negative integers or non-integer inputs before returning `True` or `False` by using the `if a < 0 or a == 0` condition.\n2. The function may not handle multi-digit numbers efficiently. For example, the function may need to be modified to handle numbers with more than two digits. You can add a check for the length of the input before attempting to factor it by using the `if len(str(a)) > max_digits` condition.\n3. The function may not handle certain edge cases correctly. For example, the function may need to be modified to handle inputs that are exactly equal to 1 or 0. You can add a check for this case by using the `if a == 1 or a == 0` condition.\n\nHere's an example of how you can modify the function to handle negative integers and multi-digit numbers:\n```\ndef is_multiply_prime(a, max_digits=10):\n    if a < 0 or a == 0:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check if a is divisible by any number from 1 to sqrt(a)\n    for i in range(1, int(a ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if a % i == 0:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check the length of the input\n    if len(str(a)) > max_digits:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check if a is negative or 0\n    if a < 0 or a == 0:\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n```\nI hope this helps!

Add a check to ensure that the input string is not empty before attempting to split it into words.\n4. Add a check to ensure that the words array has at least one element.\n\nHere\\'s the full implementation:\n```python\ndef words_string(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    You will be given a string of words separated by commas or spaces. Your task is\n    to split the string into words and return an array of the words.\n    \n    For example:\n    words_string(\"Hi, my name is John\") == [\"Hi\", \"my\", \"name\", \"is\", \"John\"]\n    words_string(\"One, two, three, four, five, six\") == [\"One\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\", \"five\", \"six\"]\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the input string is empty\n    if not s:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input string is empty.\")\n\n    # Split the input string into words\n    words = s.split()\n\n    # Check if the words array has at least one element\n    if not words:\n        raise ValueError(\"Words array has no elements.\")\n\n    # Return the words in an array\n    return words\n```\nThis implementation ensures that the `words_string` function is efficient, readable, and follows best practices.\n\nTo test the function, I would first ensure that the function has been implemented correctly according to the requirements.

The input parameter is a list of strings `lst`, and the expected output is also a list of strings in sorted order.\n\nWe can start by defining the function signature with the expected input and output:\n```python\ndef sorted_list_sum(lst):\n    \"\"\"Write a function that accepts a list of strings as a parameter,\n    deletes the strings that have odd lengths from it,\n    and returns the resulted list with a sorted order,\n    The list is always a list of strings and never an array of numbers,\n    and it may contain duplicates.\n    The order of the list should be ascending by length of each word,\n    and you should return the list sorted by that rule.\n    If two words have the same length, sort the list alphabetically.\n    The function should return a list of strings in sorted order.\n    You may assume that all words will have the same length.\n    For example:\n        assert list_sort([\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"]) => [\"aa\"]\n        assert list_sort([\"ab\", \"a\", \"aaa\", \"cd\"]) => [\"ab\", \"cd\"]\n    \"\"\"\n```\nNext, we can start implementing the function by first sorting the input list based on the length of each word. We can do this by creating a dictionary that maps each word to its index in the list. We can then use this dictionary to sort the list based on its length.\n\nWe can also handle the case where two words have the same length. In this case, we can simply insert the word again in the list at its index, and sort the list alphabetically.\n\nHere\\'s the full implementation of the `sorted_list_sum` function:\n```python\ndef sorted_list_sum(lst):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a list of strings as input and returns a list of strings in sorted order.\n    If the list is empty or contains only numbers, the function returns an empty list.\n\n    To implement this function, we first need to define the input parameters and the expected output.\n    The input parameter is a list of strings `lst`, and the expected output is also a list of strings in sorted order.\n\n    We can start by defining the function signature with the expected input and output:\n    def sorted_list_sum(lst):\n        \"\"\"Write a function that accepts a list of strings as a parameter,\n        deletes the strings that have odd lengths from it,\n        and returns the resulted list with a sorted order,\n        The list is always a list of strings and never an array of numbers,\n        and it may contain duplicates.\n        The order of the list should be ascending by length of each word,\n        and you should return the list sorted by that rule.\n        If two words have the same length, sort the list alphabetically.\n        The function should return a list of strings in sorted order.\n        You may assume that all words will have the same length.\n        For example:\n            assert list_sort([\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"]) => [\"aa\"]\n            assert list_sort([\"ab\", \"a\", \"aaa\", \"cd\"]) => [\"ab\", \"cd\"]\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Get the length of the longest word in the list\n    longest_word = max(word_len for word in lst)\n\n    # Create a dictionary that maps each word to its index in the list\n    word_index = {word: i for i, word in enumerate(lst)}\n\n    # Sort the list based on the length of each word\n    sorted_lst = sorted(word_index.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n    # Replace the word at its index with the same word, if it exists\n    sorted_lst = [(word, word_index[word], sorted_lst.index(word)) for word, word_index in sorted_lst]\n    sorted_lst = sorted_lst[1:]\n\n    # Sort the list alphabetically\n    sorted_lst.sort()\n\n    # Return the list of strings in sorted order\n    return sorted_lst\n```\nNote that this implementation assumes that the list of strings is always in alphabetical order. If the list contains duplicates, you may need to remove them before calling the function.", "result": "failed: module 'signal' has no attribute 'setitimer'", "passed": false}
